The client folder contains the react source files. 
The server folder should contain the backend source files. Both of these are a work in progress.

To run client folder, run npm i & npm up and then npm run start to test the setup.

Todo:
- Set up database for server (still deciding what to use)
- Replace placeholder icons
- Fix the resize issue in companions page
